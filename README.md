# AniTTS-Builder
=======
This program processes anime videos and subtitles to create Text-to-Speech (TTS) datasets. It extracts and cleans the audio by removing background noise, then slices it into smaller segments. Finally, the program clusters the audio by speaker for easy organization, streamlining the creation of speaker-specific TTS datasets.
